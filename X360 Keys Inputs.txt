thanks to this project for pointing me in the right direction for things:

Face buttons work like a standard Xbox 360 controller

Keys:
C1 is the leftmost key, C3 is the rightmost key

x = this bit doesn't matter
1 = this bit is activated/used by this input
Note name - Input  Decimal value  Binary value

Velocity:
	1st key: L Stick X  0b x111_1111_xxxx_xxxx
	2nd key: L Stick Y  0b xxxx_xxxx_x111_1111
	3rd key: L Stick Y  0b x111_1111_xxxx_xxxx
	4th key: R Stick X  0b xxxx_xxxx_x111_1111
	5th key: R Stick X  0b x111_1111_xxxx_xxxx
	further keys don't register velocities

Overdrive button:         Right Stick Y  128     0b xxxx_xxxx_1xxx_xxxx
Pedal port digital input: Right Stick Y  -32768  0b 1xxx_xxxx_xxxx_xxxx

Right Stick Y 32512 0b x111_1111_xxxx_xxxx is always active after pressing the overdrive button for some reason, maybe it's used for the analog input portion of the pedal port?

Effect slider: just increments the XInput packet count as far as I can tell, no inputs assigned to it. Probably not possible to get its data via XInput, but it's gotta be possible some way else, RB3 can get position data from it.
