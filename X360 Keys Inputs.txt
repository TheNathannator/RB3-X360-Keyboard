thanks to this project for pointing me in the right direction for things:

Subtype number: 15
Face buttons work like a standard Xbox 360 controller

x = this bit doesn't matter
1 = this bit is activated/used by this input, and active high (i.e. when equal to 1).
0 = this bit is activated/used by this input, active low (i.e. when equal to 0).

Keys:
C1 is the leftmost key, C3 is the rightmost key

Note - Input      Integer Binary

Velocity:
	1st key: L Stick X  0b x111_1111_xxxx_xxxx
	2nd key: L Stick Y  0b xxxx_xxxx_x111_1111
	3rd key: L Stick Y  0b x111_1111_xxxx_xxxx
	4th key: R Stick X  0b xxxx_xxxx_x111_1111
	5th key: R Stick X  0b x111_1111_xxxx_xxxx

	Velocities get registered from left to right on the keyboard, with the exception that if all velocity slots were already filled, no new velocities will be registered.
	If there are open velocity slots and a key in-between any of the current keys is pressed, the velocities will be re-ordered to be in line with the keys from left to right.
	Example: Pressing C1, E1, D1, F1, and G1 in that order will result in a final velocity state of 1: C1, 2: D1, 3: E1, 4: F1, 5: G1.

	If there are no open velocity slots and a key in-between currently-pressed key is pressed, the velocity won't get registered until a velocity slot opens, at which point they'll be registered as a velocity of 64.
	Example 1: Pressing C1, D1, E1, F1, G1, A1, and B1 will result in 1: C1, 2: D1, 3: E1, 4: F1, 5: G1.
	           Then, releasing D1 and E1 will result in 1: C1, 2: F1, 3: G1, 4: A1 = 64, 5: B1 = 64.
	Example 2: Pressing C1, E1, F1, G1, and A1 will result in 1: C1, 2: E1, 3: F1, 4: G1, 5: A1.
	           Then if you press D1, it'll still result in 1: C1, 2: E1, 3: F1, 4: G1, 5: A1.
			   Then if you release A1, it'll result in 1: C1, 2: D1 = 64, 3: E1, 4: F1, 5: G1.

	There is an issue, at least on my keyboard, where if a key is pressed, then released only slightly, then pressed again, it will not register a velocity whatsoever.
	This can wreak havoc on velocity recognition and is a bit of a pain to account for in my experience.

Overdrive button:         Right Stick Y  128     0b xxxx_xxxx_1xxx_xxxx
Pedal port digital input: Right Stick Y  -32768  0b 1xxx_xxxx_xxxx_xxxx
Pedal port analog input:  Right Stick Y          0b x000_0000_xxxx_xxxx

Effect slider: just increments the XInput packet count as far as I can tell, no inputs assigned to it. Probably not possible to get its data via XInput, but it's gotta be possible some way else, RB3 can get position data from it.
