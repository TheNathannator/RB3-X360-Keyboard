# RB3 X360 Keyboard
## About
This program allows you to use an Xbox 360 RB3 keyboard for things while connected to an Xbox 360 wireless receiver, via either an emulated Xbox 360 controller, keypresses, or MIDI inputs.

Currently, the touch strip is not supported. Also, the different pedal modes are not set up yet, I have yet to figure out what each of them do.

## Installation

1. Download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/TheNathannator/RB3_X360_Keyboard/releases/latest).
2. Extract the contents of the .zip into a new folder.
3. Install the [ViGEmBus driver](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases/latest) if you wish to use Xbox 360 controller emulation.
4. Install MIDI loopback software such as [loopMIDI](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html) if you wish to use MIDI output.

## Research

I have documented everything I've learned about the keyboard inputs so far in [a .txt file included in this repo.](https://github.com/TheNathannator/RB3_X360_Keyboard/blob/main/X360%20Keys%20Inputs.txt) I will update it with new info as I progress through development.
