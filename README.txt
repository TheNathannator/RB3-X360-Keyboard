=== RB3 X360 Keyboard ===
- About -
This program allows you to use an Xbox 360 RB3 keyboard for things while connected to an Xbox 360 wireless receiver, via either an emulated Xbox 360 controller, keypresses, or MIDI inputs.

- Notes - 
Currently, the touch strip is not supported. Also, the different pedal modes are not set up yet, I have yet to figure out what each of them do.

Install the ViGEmBus driver from https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases/latest if you wish to use Xbox 360 controller emulation.
Install MIDI loopback software such as loopMIDI from https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html if you wish to use MIDI output.
